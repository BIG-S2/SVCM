# SVCM

SVCM R package is to fit the spatially varying coefficient model to delineate the association between massive imaging data and a set of covariates of interest. The model is based on using the propagation-seperation method to adaptively and
spatially smooth each component of the coefficients.

Through this R package, you can repeat the simulation study and ADHD data analysis in the origin paper. You can also do your own real data analysis.  Please refer to the example code in the manual pdf file for more details.
